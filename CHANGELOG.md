## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Settings page: full visual redesign to match scene gallery design language — sharp 3px corners, `surface-card-sharp` cards, LED indicators on toggles and library roots, gradient glow on Save button, floating section headers with accent icons.
- Settings page: storage section uses `surface-stat` cards with meter bars and accent Total card instead of flat rows.
- Settings page: scrapers link gets pill-accent count badge and hover glow effect.
- Settings page: toggle cards are full clickable buttons instead of checkbox labels.
- Settings page: Save Changes button only activates (accent gradient + glow) when settings are dirty; stays dimmed when no changes pending.
- Settings page: file browser simplified — navigating auto-selects the current folder, removing the extra "Use Current Folder" step. Added cancel button and scrollable directory listing.
- Scrapers page: installed scrapers section is now collapsible with chevron toggle; capability filter merged into the collapsible header bar.
- Scrapers page: scraper cards and community index entries use `surface-card-sharp` for better visibility against the dark background.
- Jobs page: full visual redesign — stats strip (Active/Completed/Failed/Last Scan), queues in responsive grid with LED indicators and dark stat cells, scrollable Recent Runs table with error row tinting, section separators with accent icons.
- Bulk scrape page: unified Scenes + Performers tabs in one view, seek mode cycles all capable scrapers per item (5s timeout), auto-accept option, stats strip with progress meter, shows matched scraper name, sharp card design language.
- Bulk scrape: each scraped field is toggleable via checkbox (defaults all enabled), allowing users to exclude specific fields before accepting. Disabled fields shown struck-through.
- Bulk scrape: scraper selector dropdown to choose a specific scraper or "Seek all" mode.
- Bulk scrape: "Show all" toggle to include organized scenes and complete performers.
- Bulk scrape: expand all / collapse all for reviewing results in bulk.
- Bulk scrape: performer detail shows portrait images with selection thumbnails when multiple images returned.
- Bulk scrape: performer scraper results now require exact name match to reduce false positives from partial/first-name matches.
- Scene scrape accept now downloads thumbnail from scraped imageUrl when the "image" field is selected.
- Scene expanded detail redesigned: large thumbnail on left with toggle, fields on right in 2-column grid, performers as accent tag-chips and tags as default tag-chips, each individually removable with X buttons.
- API accept endpoint supports `excludePerformers` and `excludeTags` arrays to skip specific items during import.

### Fixed

- Bulk scrape scene matching now ignores URL-scoped scraper variants when the scene URL does not match, preventing unrelated community scrapers from claiming scenes and leaking malformed metadata.
- Scraped scene dates now reject structured payloads and other unparseable values instead of storing raw JSON-LD blobs in the `date` field.
- Library scan now skips preview/sample files (`-preview.mp4`, `_preview.mp4`, `-sample.mp4`, `-thumb.mp4`, `-sprite.mp4`) preventing duplicate scene entries. Previously imported preview files are cleaned up on next scan.
- HTML entities (`&amp;`, `&quot;`, etc.) in filenames and scraper results are now decoded correctly in titles and metadata fields.

### Added

- Full performer CRUD API: `POST /performers`, `PATCH /performers/:id`, `DELETE /performers/:id`, favorite/rating quick toggles.
- Performer image pipeline: upload, download from URL (including base64 data URLs), and asset serving at `/assets/performers/:id/image`.
- Performer scraping API: `POST /scrapers/:id/scrape-performer` with action cascade (performerByURL, performerByName, performerByFragment).
- `POST /performers/:id/apply-scrape` for applying scrape results with selective field application.
- Enhanced scene scrape acceptance: when accepting a scene scrape, performer metadata (gender, birthdate, country, image, etc.) is now applied from raw scraper data instead of discarding everything except names.
- `performerTags` join table for tagging performers independently of scenes.
- `imagePath` column on performers for locally-stored portrait images.
- Database indexes on performers: name, gender, favorite, rating, created_at.
- Performer normalizer (`normalizePerformerResult`) in stash-import package.
- Performer list page with portrait grid cards (3:4 aspect), server-side filtering (gender, favorites), sorting (name, scenes, rating, recent), pagination, and debounced search.
- Performer detail page with sidebar portrait layout, interactive favorite/rating, metadata grid with age calculation, tags, biography, and scene filmography.
- Performer edit component with full form fields, scraper integration panel with result preview and selective field application, image upload/delete, and tag management.
- Bulk performer scrape page at `/performers/scrape` with sequential scraping, auto-accept option, and per-row accept/reject.
- Performer route constants and DTOs (`PerformerListItemDto`, `PerformerDetailDto`, `PerformerUpdateDto`, `NormalizedPerformerResult`) in contracts.
- Frontend API client functions for all performer CRUD, image, and scraping operations.
- Scrapers page: stats strip (installed/scene/performer counts), capability filter toolbar, human-readable capability labels with categorized accent styling, performer capabilities highlighted with brass chips.
- Community index: checkbox selection with select-all toggle and bulk install action bar for installing multiple scrapers at once. Browse button uses Globe icon, switches to RefreshCw after index loads.
- Settings page: scrapers section replaced with link card to dedicated `/scrapers` page, tightened design language with proper kicker labels and accent styling.
- Seek button on scene and performer scraper panels: automatically cycles through all installed scrapers until one returns results. Pressing again continues from the next scraper in the list. Uses SkipForward (media player) icon, enforces 5-second timeout per scraper.
- Image picker in performer scrape results: when scrapers return multiple images, user can click to select which portrait to use.
- Performer portrait thumbnails now displayed across all scene views: scene detail chips (36x48px portraits), scene edit tag chips (inline 16x12px), scene grid list mode, MediaCard grid cards, and dashboard recent additions.

- Dashboard added to sidebar nav as first item under a new "Overview" section; logo/logomark now link to `/` so clicking the logo always navigates home.
- Dashboard page now displays live library stats (scene count, total duration, storage, weekly additions) and job activity feed from the API, replacing hardcoded zeroes.
- Performers listing page wired to `GET /performers` with client-side search/sort, performer card grid, and links to detail pages.
- Performers detail page using `GET /performers/:id` (new endpoint) — shows bio, career metadata, and a full scene grid filtered by performer.
- Studios listing page wired to `GET /studios` with search/sort and cards linked to detail pages.
- Studios detail page using `GET /studios/:id` (new endpoint) — shows studio info and filtered scene grid.
- Tags listing page wired to `GET /tags` — live tag cloud (top 40 sorted by scene count) with navigation links, plus a searchable tag list.
- Tags detail page using `fetchScenes({ tag: [name] })` — real scene grid for each tag.
- `GET /performers/:id` API endpoint returning full performer metadata (bio, aliases, gender, birthdate, country, career dates, etc.).
- `GET /studios/:id` API endpoint returning studio detail (name, URL, image).
- `fetchPerformerDetail` and `fetchStudioDetail` helper functions added to `api.ts`.
- Galleries and Collections pages upgraded to properly styled Dark Control Room empty states with contextual links.
- `GET /galleries` API returning an empty typed list until gallery persistence exists; `GalleryListItemDto` and `apiRoutes.galleries` in contracts; `fetchGalleries` on the web client.

### Fixed

- MediaCard touch scrub on mobile: horizontal swipe now locks into scrub mode via direction detection (8 px threshold) instead of being cancelled by vertical scroll.

### Changed

- Dashboard hero logo and title enlarged to proper hero size (48 px mark, `text-2xl` title); removed redundant “Home” subtitle.
- Dashboard: removed redundant “System channels” row; added “Recent additions” ingest strip (motion vs stills labels, merged sort by `createdAt`, horizontal snap scroll, optional dashed “stills slot” when no galleries); hero and “Library” labels tightened.
- Dashboard hero clock defers live updates until after mount so SSR and hydration match; recent scene tiles use the same `MediaCard` stack as the scenes gallery (shared `SCENE_TAG_COLORS` map).
- Dashboard copy trimmed: hero uses app `Logo` plus short subtitle; section headings and empty states shortened; stats row has no kicker label.
- Dashboard UI aligned with the scene gallery and player: glass hero with brass glow, sharp `surface-card-sharp` panels, gradient meter strips on stats, per-queue telemetry rack, and browse tiles with glass icon wells and gradient accents; logic split into `components/dashboard/*` modules.
- Unified Docker deployment into a single all-in-one image (`ghcr.io/pauljoda/obscura`) with PostgreSQL, Redis, nginx, and all application services bundled together.
- Simplified docker-compose.yml to a single service with two volume mounts (`/data` and `/media`).
- Only port 8008 is exposed — nginx reverse proxy routes API requests internally.
- Updated CI/CD workflow to build and publish the unified image.
- Replaced private license with Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
- Rewrote README with simplified quick start, `docker run` one-liner, and zero-configuration deployment.
